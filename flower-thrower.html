                <p><b>Location:</b> Multiple locations in West Bank; originally on the West Bank Wall, 
                    image provided is on the side of a car wash in West Bank</p> 
                <p><b>Estimated Creation Date:</b> 2003</p>
                <p><b>Description:</b> A man dressed as some kind of militant/protestor covering his 
                    face and wearing a baseball cap backwards is poised to throw a bouquet of flowers as if they 
                    were a molotov or some other kind or explosive. He appears angry.</p>
                <p><b>Theme:</b> Hope against violence.</p>
                <p><b>Context:</b> This piece appeared in 2003 on the side of a garage in Bayt Sahour, 
                    a Palestinian town near Bethlehem. The location was chosen due to its close proximity to 
                    the wall built by Israel that separates it from the West Bank as a call for nonviolence and a 
                    statement against political injustice in the region. Initially Banksy painted a set of graffiti 
                    works on the wall itself, but it was quickly scrubbed away. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis:</b> The main subject of the work, the militant wielding the bouquet of flowers, is 
                    painted in Banksy’s traditional all-black spray paint stencil style. In contrast, the flowers in 
                    the bouquet are hand-painted in a myriad of colors, a rare occurrence in the artist’s collection of works. 
                    This contrast between colorful oil paint flowers and the harsh stencilled militant represents hope against 
                    violence and peace defiantly prevailing in the face of brutality.</p>
