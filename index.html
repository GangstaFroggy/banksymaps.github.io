            <h1>About Banksy</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>An activist known for his graffiti, Banksy places his marks around the world 
                    and has been doing so since the 1990s. Using lifelike details, Banksy 
                    poignantly chooses areas for their political, social, or cultural conflicts 
                    as part of his artistic method. Known for its picture-like quality, Banksy’s 
                    stencil art deviates from popular graffiti.</p>
                <p>As to Banksy’s true identity, it currently remains unknown. He could be an 
                    individual, a group, or an idea. What is more important than his identity 
                    is his influence; especially regarding social movements.</p>
                <p><b>Stencil art (pochoir)</b> - Banksy’s signature style. A cut out is used to maintain 
                    sharp, concise edges, and is typically reusable. </p>
