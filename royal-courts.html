            <h1 class="italics"> Judge Striking Protestor</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Location:</b> Royal Courts of Justice, London, UK</p> 
                <p><b>Estimated Creation Date:</b> September 2025</p>
                <p><b>Description:</b> There is a protester on the ground and he is holding up a blank sign. 
                    The lower half of the sign has blood spatter on it. A judge is on his knees over the protester 
                    with a gavel. The judge in an about-to-strike position. </p>
                <p><b>Theme:</b> Suppression of protest groups.</p>
                <p><b>Context:</b> The UK government was trying to stop the protests of Palestine Action, a pro-Palastine 
                    direct action network, after it was proscribed as a terrorist organization (the government bans a 
                    group, making it illegal to exist). It was during this time that the mural appeared on the side of the 
                    Royal Courts of Justice. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis:</b> As with many of Banksy’s works, Judge Striking Protester is site specific. The piece wouldn’t 
                    hold the same weight if it were placed anywhere else. By depicting a judge as beating a protester, Banksy asserts 
                    that the Royal Courts are subverting justice, betraying their namesake. In a fair legal system, punishment should 
                    come after someone has been found guilty in a court of law. Also importantly, punishment should fit the crime. 
                    Justice is defined as the process of using laws to fairly judge cases, redress wrongs, and punish crimes. In other 
                    words, justice is meant to be honorable. In this case, however, expectations of justice have been beaten until bloody.
                    <br><br>
                    The judge in this artwork has disrupted the judicial process. Instead of having multiple conditions to be met before the punishment is 
                    given, one entity has all the decision power. The roles of judge, jury, and executioner have been combined. The jury, the 
                    voice of the people, has been cut out of the process. This corruption leads to unfair abuse. Banksy criticizes the United Kingdom’s 
                    government for labeling Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. As it is a pro-Palestine group, many see the government’s actions 
                    as suppressing freedom of speech and political protest. Just because a group protests government action does not mean it is a terrorist 
                    group. In any fair country, the people must be allowed to criticize the government. Just like how juries must be given a voice in law, the people must be given a voice in government.
