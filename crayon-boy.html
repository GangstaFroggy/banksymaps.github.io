            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Location:</b> Los Angeles, California, United States</p> 
                <p><b>Estimated Creation Date:</b> February 2011</p>
                <p><b>Description:</b> A young boy dressed as a soldier painted in black and white aiming a machine gun. 
                    The gun contains colorful crayons in place of bullets and the boy is surrounded by flowers painted in 
                    the style of a child’s crayon drawing.</p>
                <p><b>Theme:</b> Violence taking away children’s innocence.</p>
                <p><b>Context:</b> This art piece was painted over roughly a week after initially being put up. It was painted 
                    in Los Angeles in 2011 at a time when gun violence in the United States was at an all-time high. </p>
                <p><b>Analysis:</b> Often, Banksy will use juxtaposition in his artworks to truly point out disparities that may 
                    otherwise be overlooked. In Crayon Boy, the juxtaposition is extremely clear. The child is drawn in black and 
                    white, already symbolizing a loss of innocence. The firearm that the child holds is also black and white, and 
                    is as long as the boy is tall. Surrounded by colorful, childlike drawings, ones characteristic of a kindergarten 
                    classroom, one can fully appreciate the horror that the image evokes. Instead of using crayons to draw or explore 
                    creativity, the boy uses them as ammunition. Through this piece, Banksy contends that violence is shaping 
                    children. Instead of being given tools for their development and creativity, children are given tools of violence.</p>
