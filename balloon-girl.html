            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Location:</b> Waterloo Bridge, South Bank, London, England (piece is no longer there)</p> 
                <p><b>Estimated Creation Date:</b> 2002</p>
                <p><b>Description:</b> A young girl drawn in black and white stands with her 
                    right arm outstretched towards a red, heart-shaped balloon. Often paired 
                    with the phrase “There is always hope.”</p>
                <p><b>Theme:</b> The fragility of innocence and hope.</p>
                <p><b>Context:</b> After the initial artwork was made, several later iterations 
                    addressed various social campaigns, including the Syrian refugee crisis and 
                    the 2017 UK election. Additionally, in 2018, a framed copy was sold, but the 
                    frame shredded the work as part of the experience, dubbing it “Love is in the Bin.”</p>
                <p><b>Analysis:</b> This piece is perhaps the most famous of Banksy’s works and 
                    demonstrates some of his typical stylistic features. Often, Banksy will use 
                    children to symbolize innocence and highlight the conditions that people face. 
                    Images using children are typically more controversial; especially in present 
                    society, children are meant to be protected. However, Banksy’s use of children 
                    in tragic scenarios emphasizes their laments, bringing their struggles to the 
                    viewer’s attention more effectively than if the subject were an adult.</p>
